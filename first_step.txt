Your request to transform the legal lease agreement into a smart contract encompasses many conditions and stipulations. Due to the complexity and multi conditional structure of the legal contract, the translated smart contract will be simplified and will only contain basic key points like Lease Term, Rental Amount, and Security Deposit. It also assumes that other real-world checks (like checking a tenant's criminal background, tenant's agreement on no pets or no smoking policy, and Landlord's responsibilities like maintenance) would be managed outside the blockchain.

Specific parts of the legal contract may not be addressed in the smart contract due to the limitation of blockchain technology. Penalty charges like Late Fees, Real-world inspections, Lawful usage of premises, any other information requiring off-chain inputs are not handled in this contract. Moreover, as smart contracts are self-executing immutable contracts, the dispute resolution and contract termination conditions are also not taken into account.

```solidity 
pragma solidity ^0.5.1;

contract LeaseAgreement {
    //Struct to store Tenant Info
    struct Tenant {
        address tenantAddress;
        bool isTenant;
    }
    //Declaration of variables
    address public landlord;
    uint256 public leaseTermEndDate;
    uint256 public rent;
    uint256 public securityDeposit;

    // Mapping to save the tenants
    mapping(address => Tenant) tenants;
    
    // Function to set landlord details
    constructor(uint256 _leaseTermEndDate, uint256 _rent, uint256 _securityDeposit) public{
        landlord = msg.sender;
        leaseTermEndDate=now+_leaseTermEndDate;
        rent=_rent;
        securityDeposit=_securityDeposit;
    }
   
    // Landlord adds a tenant & deposits received here
    function addTenant(address _tenantAddress) public payable {
        require(msg.sender == landlord, "Only landlord can add a tenant");
        require(msg.value == securityDeposit + rent, "Rent and Security Deposit required");
        
        Tenant storage tenant = tenants[_tenantAddress];
        tenant.tenantAddress = _tenantAddress;
        tenant.isTenant = true;
    }

    // Tenant pays rent
    function payRent() public payable {
        require(msg.sender == tenants[msg.sender].tenantAddress, "Only tenants can pay rent");
        require(msg.value == rent ,"Rent amount required");
        landlord.transfer(msg.value); 
    }

    // Refund of security deposit after lease end
    function refundSecurityDeposit(address _tenantAddress) public {
        require(msg.sender == landlord, "Only landlord can refund deposit");
        require(now > leaseTermEndDate, "Lease term not ended");
        _tenantAddress.transfer(securityDeposit);
    }
}
```
This smart contract allows for creating an agreement with specific lease term, rent, and security deposit. It allows the landlord to add tenants, tenants to pay rent and also the refunding of security deposit after the lease term ends. Your team can use online blockchain platforms like Remix to compile and deploy this code on any Ethereum Test Network. 

Remember: The terms in Smart Contracts are executed by code and do not have the capacity to interpret the intent behind the original language of legal terms. Legal contracts can have complex, subjective terms and conditions interpreted by the court. But smart contracts execute terms literally. So, the necessary legal advice must be sought before converting a legal contract to a smart contract.
